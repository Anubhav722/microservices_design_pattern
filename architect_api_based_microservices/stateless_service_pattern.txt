the patterns are not keeping states within the service between calls.

An example of a stateful service would be a service that uses the session facilities at the server end and provides a session id in order to keep a track of states between calls made to the service.

STATEFUL SERVICES:
- avoid for microservices

Stateless Service Pattern:
- no state information maintained. (between requests no data related to requests must be held in memory at the server end.)
- Clients maintain state. (state of the request)
- State sent as part of the request.

ADVANTAGES FOR MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE:
- Scalability; performance and availability


DISADVANTAGE:
- Increases network traffic; (because each request now contains more data which describes the overall transaction in the request state and this needs to be transmitted across network.)
