Steps involved in planning microservice architecture:

1. how to scope microservices using bounded contexts
2. how to architect asynchronous microservices
3. how to architect API based microservices
4. how to compose microservices together
5. how to achieve data consistency across microservices
6. how to centralize access to microservices using an API Gateway
7. how to split monolithic databases across microservices
8. how to make microservices more resilient
9. how to make microservices backwards compatible.
10. how to define and document microservice contracts
11. how to implement microservices centralized logging
12. how to provide reporting from distributed microservices data
13. how to automate the deployment of your microservices architecture
14. how to approach cloud based microservices infrastructure
